# Data-preprocessing preparing the data for machine learning model
Data preprocessing is the step that comes after EDA and focuses on preparing the data for machine learning model. The primary goal is to clean, transform, and pre-process the data to ensure it is in a suitable format for training machine learning models. In data preprocessing, various techniques are applied to clean the data (handling missing values, removing duplicates), transform the data(scaling, normalization),handle categorical variables(encoding), perform feature engineering, and deal with outliers.
I)HANDLING MISSING VALUES
II)HANDLING IMBALANCED DATASET
III)LABEL ENCODING
IV)DATA STANDARDIZATION
